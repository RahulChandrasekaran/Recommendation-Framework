# Recommendation-Framework
# Introduction:

       In the software sector, when a project team lags and it affects the client deadline, it creates issues that are in the future.
       By utilizing the gradient boosting algorithm and aiding in the resolution of the cold start-problem, the suggestion concept
       in this situation will be able to address the problem and successfully complete the project within the allotted time.
       The recommendation system can essentially be used to resolve the core idea or scope of the issue that emerges from the organizing team.
       
   

# Methodology:

There are four stages:

 1.Client
 
 2.Manager
 
 3.Project team
 
 4.Technical team
 
 
 1.Client:
 
 Their personal information in the client details part, and the next process is upload the project requirement section which contains what are the service is need to be done and the client denote the deadline for completion of project and client should select that domain, where they can upload their project details and project document with their requirements.


2.Manager:


They move into the client project request section, where the manager look into the client request and requirement and deadline  analyses the client project document and approves and sends the credential details to both the client and the project team.

3.Project team:

A project team head verifies the client project team request and then report the project inquiry to manager , if the project team finds the project cannot complete the project with given time the report will be forwarded to the technical team.

4.Technical team:

Then team will view the data forwarded by project team and then using gradient boosting algorithm technical team will provide the result to the project team which helps the team will alter the work according from the inspection data and deliver the project in the right time.
